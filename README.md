## Leaving the Warehouse
You must load your truck to a minimum level depending on difficulty, after which you will be able to depart and commence your selling journey. Simply drag an item on the right to your trunk, keep in mind you can only stack things so high, depending on your vehicle.

Anything left behind at the warehouse will not affect your score so spend your initial time organizing your trunk. However, make sure to not leave anything behind at your market stops on your trip, if you leave too much behind you will lose!

## Selling at the Market
Once you get to a market you will have the opportunity to sell an item from your truck, each item is worth a different amount so try to see what items are worth the most. If you miss too many opportunities to sell items, either because you abandoned them or ran out of time unburying it, you will lose!


After you sell an item you can refill your inventory with additional items for your journey, make sure to keep enough items in your trunk, If you have too few wares in your trunk when you depart you will lose!

See how much money you can make!
